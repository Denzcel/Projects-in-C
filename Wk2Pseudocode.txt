Create logical flow for a program that let the user input five numbers.  
(These five numbers can be stored in an array.) The program output 
should be the output of the average of these five numbers by reading 
them out of the array and calculating the average and indicating the 
highest number entered. Please use loops, arrays and conditional statements! 
Please comment what you did and why.

Pseudocode:
1. Start Main function
2. Create an array num for 5 elements -> num[5]
3. Assign values to each array index num[5] to num[4]
4. For loop to iterate through the values and add them
5. Using IF Compare current number with new number and store highest
6. Divide by the number of elements (5) giving average
7. Print the output of the highest number and average

// Used for loop to grab the five elements in order to find the average 
and highest number, then continued to compare the numbers until the highest 
number is met and store that value.
